Software Engineer - Biller
Hi Nikita ' OR 1 -- .,

Hope you are doing well. Not sure if you saw the recent news about Biller (https://bit.ly/BillerKlarnaMollie), but things are progressing really fast! The founders (Derek, Mick and Uwe) are securing a big round of funding this month and building out their Amsterdam-based tech team to accelerate development of their AI-powered buy-now, pay-later solution for B2B. I thought you might be an ideal talent to join them on this exciting journey.

I think your background would be a great fit with the team. Does this opportunity sound interesting to you? If so, I would be happy to set up a meeting for you with one of the founders, or with one of the engineers on the team, to learn more. I think it’s a really cool opportunity to join a well-backed startup at the earliest of days – building this company together with the founding team. I look forward to hearing from you!

High performance, low latency, financial markets… Are you ready to make a difference in trading Nikita ' OR 1 -- .?
Good afternoon Nikita ' OR 1 -- .,

Currently, I am exclusively looking for a skilled Python Developer, for a high-frequency trading company in Amsterdam. As a High-Frequency trading firm, it breathes technology. For every trader on the floor, there are at least two developers. Make no mistake, IT is their core business. Because in such a highly competitive market, performance, speed, and reliability are key. Which is where you come in. To speed up innovation and boost productivity throughout the company, a new team is being formed. And you could be a part of it. They are looking to hire the best Python Developers they can find for some of the most technically demanding projects they have. Things like building a simulation framework for large parts of the IT landscape, so changes can be properly analyzed before pushing them to production.

As mentioned earlier, your particular skill set and experience have caught my attention. Considering your recent focus on Python development, I think this could be a great match. I say that because of your broad background and your work, I think you’ll see what I mean.

https://searchxrecruitment.com/en/job/python-developer-3827

I am very curious about your background, your ambitions, and what your dream job looks like. I always put a lot of time and effort into getting to know my clients and their needs. In this way, I can paint a better picture of the position, the organization, and the people who work there in a personal conversation. I believe that this is the only way to provide our candidates with substantial insight into the company's culture and to create a perfect match.

I look forward to hearing from you soon,

Senior Python Developer (Remote)
Hi Nikita ' OR 1 -- .!
My name is Aleksandra, I am a Senior IT Recruiter at ReadyTal and I came across your LinkedIn profile while searching for a Senior Python Developer to fill a position that just opened up.
I was impressed with your skills. I think you may be a great fit, here are some quick details about the opportunity:

- 100% Remote, full time.
- Compensation range- $6500-7500
- Company - US
- Industry - Audio Streaming

The company helps to streamline CDN operations, grow users, and assist with statutory licensing and publishing rights.
Since 2010 the company has stood for the highest quality audio delivery platform in the industry.

The main requirements:
- Python 3 (Django, flask, FastApi, and pure python workers)
- Strong communication skills in English

Would you be interested in applying for this position?

To apply to the offer stage, we have our own two-step quick screening process - these particular employers come to ReadyTal precisely for this reason.

Step 1: have a 20-minute Zoom call with our talent associate. They'll just ask to confirm your skills, and where you are located, and mostly ensure that your level of English is acceptable for working in remote teams in the process. It's not technical at all.

Step 2: we'll send you an online assessment test, personalized to your top skills.
This takes on average up to an hour. However, once it's done, you're actually eligible for all future offers on our platform, not just for this one opportunity.

To get going, please click on the link below to submit your details. It will take just 2 minutes, and works well with your schedule to have that 15-minute call: https://readytal.typeform.com/anadezhdina#ref=anadezhdina

Happy to answer any questions that you may have in the meantime.

I hope you have a great day!
